# leocore_firmware

The firmware for the [LeoCore] controller running inside Leo Rover. 

The main functionalities include:
- velocity commands for the robot,
- velocity and PWM commands for individual wheels,
- battery voltage feedback,
- wheel states (position, velocity, torque, PWM duty) feedback,
- odometry feedback (calculated from wheel encoders),
- feedback from the IMU sensor.

The project is written for [PlatformIO] and uses the [STM32Cube] embedded software libraries. The low-level code is generated by the [STM32CubeMX] tool.

The firmware also uses [rosserial] client library to expose its functionalities on ROS topics, services and parameters. For the documentation of the ROS API, visit [leo_fw] on the ROS wiki.

## Prerequisites
To build the project, all you'll need is [Visual Studio Code] with the [PlatformIO IDE] extension.

To change the [STM32CubeMX] configuration, you will also need the [stm32pio] tool in order to properly regenerate the code.

## Building
Open the project in [PlatformIO IDE], then run the `PlatformIO: Build` task.

## Flashing
### Using ST-Link programmer
Connect the ST-Link to the pins on the [LeoCore] debug pin header, then run the `PlatformIO: Upload` task.

You can also run the GDB debugger by running the `PIO Debug` launch configuration (or just clicking `F5`).

### Using RPi on Leo Rover
Upload the `.pio/build/genericSTM32F401RC/firmware.bin` to Leo Rover, then, on the robot, run:
```
rosrun leo_fw flash firmware.bin
```

## Modifying STM32CubeMX configuration\
Open the `leocore.ioc` project in [STM32CubeMX], make the changes and save the project.

**Don't** click `GENERATE CODE`. Instead, type:
```
stm32pio generate
```
The current configuration assumes that [STM32CubeMX] is installed under `/opt/STM32CubeMX`. You can change the path in the `stm32pio.ini` file.
